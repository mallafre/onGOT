It is not a complete game, it is just a useful tool which can be used to
play a online multiplayer version of the board game Game of Thrones.

This tool can be used to online generate a image of the board map status, 
including all the icons/tokens of the current status of the game.

There must be a coordinator (one of the players) who is in charge of modify the
board map using this tool. The players send his movements and instructions to the
coordinator using irc, email, forum or any kind of message system.

It is for 9 players and the duration of the game might be of more than one month.
